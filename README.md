# Analysis-of-Missing-Migrant-Incidents

### Introduction

This project is to shed some light into deaths of hundreds of migrants that are fleeing from countries engulfed in warfare and conflicts, or simply trying to find a better place to live in. Hopefully, we will get a better understanding of the circumstances of their deaths and get to know overall patterns from that tragedies. We hope that monitoring these tragic events and studying the data relating to them can help to avoid a recurrence of these.

### Dataset description

The dataset comes from the Missing Migrant Project that tracks the deaths of migrants that have perished on their way to their destination. The dataset contains observations that have been collected from all over the world.

### Assumptions

Missing Migrants Project records deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have died or gone missing in the process of migration towards an international destination. These data represent minimum estimates, as many deaths during migration go unrecorded. We have dealt with missing values in the entire process.
